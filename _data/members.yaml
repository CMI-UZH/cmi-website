  description: "My career spans across both medicine and biomedical informatics: After receiving my M.D. degree at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and board certification as general practitioner, I obtained a Ph.D. in biomedical informatics at Columbia University in New York. At Columbia, I worked on a pioneering text mining system called ‚ÄúGeneWays‚Äù that used Big Data analytics for predicting novel disease candidate genes. I then joined Yale School of Medicine (Pathology) where I lead a research team in biomedical informatics. Among other accomplishments, our work at Yale was instrumental in establishing the molecular classification of melanoma.  In 2018, I moved back to Zurich to establish a group in Medical Informatics. In my spare time I like to read and work on various DIY projects"
