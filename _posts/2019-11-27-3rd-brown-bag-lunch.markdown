Last week's Brown Bag Lunch was hosted by the Medical Informatics Group of
University of Zurich.

Prof. Krauthammer provided an overview of our group's overall aim and projects 
we are currently working on to our colleagues from the Research Data Service
Center (RDSC) at [UniSpital Z&uuml;rich (USZ)](http://www.en.usz.ch){:target="_blank"}.
We are glad about the good collaboration with the team of the RDSC, which
enables great research by providing us with high quality data.

In case you are interested in joining our regular brown bag lunches, during which
we inform about our research in a casual atmosphere, do not hesitate to contact us.
For every other event we also provide a platform for collaborators to present
their work.
