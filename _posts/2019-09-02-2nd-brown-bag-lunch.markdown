Last week, the Research Data Service Center (RDSC) of [UniSpital Z&uuml;rich
(USZ)](http://www.en.usz.ch){:target="_blank"} hosted the 2<sup>nd</sup> event
of our jointly conducted series of Brown Bag Lunches.

Patrick Hirschi, Data Engineer at the RDSC, gave a presentation about the
teams Data Platform development. He explained the current status of the Data
Warehouse, which hosts existing and newly generated clinical data into a
state-of-the-art database system. This enables us and our colleagues to work on
the latest datasets, in the near future even in real-time, thus accelerating
research in personalized medicine.

The members of the RDSC also commented on their joint effort to integrate the
USZ into [Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN)](https://www.sphn.ch){:target="_blank"}.
The latter is a national initiative to combine medical data of all Swiss
university hospitals in a secure and standardized manner.

We are very happy to see this progression towards integrated data platforms
enabling new research opportunities and better digital health care services!
