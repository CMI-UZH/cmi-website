<p>Last week, the Research Data Service Center (RDSC) of
<a href="http://www.en.usz.ch">UniSpital Z&uuml;rich (USZ)</a> hosted th
2<sup>nd</sup> event of our jointly conducted series of Brown Bag Lunches.</p>

<p>Patrick Hirschi, Data Engineer at the RDSC, gave a presentation about the
teams Data Platform development. He explained the current status of the Data
Warehouse, which hosts existing and newly generated clinical data into a
state-of-the-art database system. Most importantly those data are anonymized
and can be used upon agreement by internal researchers. This enables us and our
colleagues to work on the latest datasets, in the near future even in real-time,
thus accelerating research in personalized medicine.</p>

<p>The members of the RDSC also commented on their joint effort to integrate the
USZ into
<a href="https://www.sphn.ch">Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN)</a>.
The latter is a national initiative to combine medical data of all Swiss
university hospitals in a secure and standardized manner.</p>

<p>We are very happy to see this progression towards integrated data platforms
enabling new research opportunities and better digital health care services!</p>
