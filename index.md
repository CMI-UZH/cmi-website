We are an interdisciplinary team lead by Prof. Michael Krauthammer working on clinical informatics, data science and translation bioinformatics. We aim at (a) deploying smart analytics for improving health care processes for patients, physicians and other professionals, (b) performing knowledge discovery from large biomedical data sets and (c) developing data-driven solution for disease prevention, diagnosis and  management.
