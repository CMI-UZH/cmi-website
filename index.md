## Welcome
We are an interdisciplinary team led by Prof. Michael Krauthammer working on clinical informatics, data science and translational bioinformatics. We aim at (a) deploying smart analytics for improving health care processes for patients, physicians and other professionals, (b) performing knowledge discovery from large biomedical data sets and (c) developing data-driven solution for disease prevention, diagnosis and management.
