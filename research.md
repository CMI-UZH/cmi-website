### Auto-Discern

We are building a machine learning system that rates the quality of health information websites, such as WebMD. 
We use the [DISCERN instrument](http://www.discern.org.uk/discern_instrument.php), 
which evaluates articles on attributes such as "are the treatment risks described" and "are the sources cited".

### 30 days all-cause readmission

**Abstract**
Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of hospital admissions in the US. Readmission within 30 days after a HF hospitalization is both a recognized indicator for disease progression and a source of considerable financial burden to the healthcare system. Consequently, the identification of patients at risk for readmission is a key step in improving disease management and patient outcome. In this work, we used a large administrative claims dataset to (1) explore the systematic application of neural network-based models versus logistic regression for predicting 30 days all-cause readmission after discharge from a HF admission, and (2) to examine the additive value of patientsâ€™ hospitalization timelines on prediction performance.
