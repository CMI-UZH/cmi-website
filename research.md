### Auto-Discern

We are building a machine learning system that rates the quality of health information websites, such as WebMD. 
We use the [DISCERN instrument](http://www.discern.org.uk/discern_instrument.php), 
which evaluates articles on attributes such as "are the treatment risks described" and "are the sources cited".
